# Bootcamp-Project #05: Weather App

This project was about building a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. It was realized in a pair programming setting.

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- Pair programming
- What an API is and how to use it
- Basic JSON
- How to use fetch() in JavaScript
- How to use promises in JavaScript
- Following a given design

This was the first project of the bootcamp that was realized in a pair programming setup. Starting out with exchanging each others expectations and week schedule to define our goal and working schedule for this project was extremely valuable. The communication was great from the beginning and the project was realized quite quickly without any bigger issues. We both started with the project individually since we both needed to let the inputs from the lecture settle first. We were talking to each other on zoom and/or exchanged problems over slack.
