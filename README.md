# Weather App

This project was about displaying data on our website, which we got from a weather API. It was realized in a pair programming setting.


## The problem

As a first step we were exchanging each others expectations to define our goal for this project and we discussed our schedule for this week and how we will be working together to reach our goal(s).
With the information from the lecture from the beginning of the week, both started with the project individually since we both needed to let the inputs from the lecture settle first. We were talking to each other on zoom and/or exchanged problems over slack. At one point we went for one particular code and started to build our site on that. Still working individually we were focusing on the same problem and as soon as solved, we met to exchange the solution and to discuss the next step.
We could get a lot of solutions to our problems on either stackoverflow, our teammembers or from the lectures. One question we asked on stackoverflow, which was answered but seemed to be above our level of knowledge (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66300888/how-to-reach-for-the-header-sectionbefore-from-the-js-for-styling). If we had more time, we probably would have worked on that. Since we both wanted to excercise if/else statements we would also have focused on that. The idea was to add animations to the weather type (animations we found online, not build ourselves). For a next project we will try to do more peercoding, we didn't do much of this in this project. 
About the responsiveness we'd like to add, that it works on the inspect-tool, which we used while working in the css, but when opening it on desktop or phone it doesn't work anymore. We tried to fix it but can't tell what the problem is, since it is working on the inspect-tool. 
The blue gradient in the header section was built as a codealong from a youtube
